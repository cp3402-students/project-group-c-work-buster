# Theme


## Overview

The theme for our website is designed to be user-friendly, professional, and visually appealing. Below, you’ll find essential details specific to our theme.

### Features

1.  **Templates**: Our website utilizes various templates for different pages. When designing a new page, consider whether there’s an existing template that can suit your needs. Reusing templates ensures consistency and maintains the overall look and feel.
    
2.  **Color Scheme**: We’ve carefully chosen a light color palette to convey professionalism and enhance readability. The color design caters to both younger and older audiences. When creating new templates, try to adhere to this color style.

## Files to Edit

While developing your theme, focus on the following files:

1.  `header.php`: Customize the header section, including navigation menus, logo placement, and any additional elements.
    
2.  `footer.php`: Modify the footer content, such as copyright information, social media links, and contact details.
    
3.  `style.css`: This stylesheet controls the overall appearance of the theme. Adjust fonts, colors, spacing, and other visual aspects here.
    
4.  Template-specific files (e.g.,  `single.php`,  `archive.php`,  `page.php`): These templates define the layout for specific content types (single posts, archives, pages). Customize them according to your design requirements.
    

## Design Decisions

1.  **Minimalistic Approach**: Our theme follows a clean and minimalistic design. Avoid clutter and unnecessary elements.
    
2.  **Responsive Design**: Ensure that your templates adapt well to different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).
    
3.  **Readable Fonts**: Use legible fonts for body text. Sans-serif fonts work well for online content.
